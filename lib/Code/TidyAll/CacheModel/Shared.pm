# ABSTRACT: Shared cache model for Code::TidyAll

__END__

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   my $cta = Code::TidyAll->new(
       cache_model_class => 'Code::TidyAll::CacheModel::Shared',
       ...
   );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An alternative caching model for Code::TidyAll designed to work in shared build
systems / systems with lots of branches.

This cache model uses both the file name and file contents to build the cache
key and a meaningless cache value. It does not care about the modification time
of the file.

This allows you to share a cache when you might have several versions of a file
that you switch backwards and forwards between (e.g. when you're working on
several branches) and keep the cache values
