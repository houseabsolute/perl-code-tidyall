0.28     2015-08-06

- The JSON plugin now uses JSON::MaybeXS instead of JSON.pm. Patch by Greg
  Oschwald. GitHub #37.

- Added a new plugin, PerlTidySweet, which uses perltidy-sweet instead of
  perltidy. Implemented by Mark Grimes. GitHub #26.


0.27     2015-07-04

[BUG FIXES]

- Fixed broken POD. Most modules were missing their NAME sections because of a
  mistake in the distro's weaver.ini file. Reported by Красимир Беров.


0.26     2015-06-29

[BUG FIXES]

- The tidyall script did not handle the -I option correctly. It was treated as
  a boolean rather than a string, meaning it basically ignored whatever you
  passed. Fixed by Andy Jack. GH #35.

- The PodChecker plugin no longer generates warnings about an undef variable
  if the file did not have any Pod.

- Added an option for the tidyall config file, shebang. This is an additional
  filter that selects files based on the shebang line
  (#!/bin/foo). Implemented by timgimyee. GH #25.

[ENHANCEMENTS]

- You can now pass "verbose => 1" to tidyall_ok(). Previously this would have
  been overridden because we unconditionally set "quiet => 1", but now we only
  do this when verbose is not specified.

- Added a new "msg_outputter" attribute to Code::TidyAll. By default, this is
  a sub that simply calls "printf", but you can pass something else to change
  how messages are printed. Test::Code::TidyAll uses this to send messages
  through diag().

- If you set "verbose => 1" when calling Test::Code::TidyAll, it will now use
  Text::Diff::Table to show details of how a file needs to be tidied in order
  to pass the tidyall checks.

- Made the PerlCritic plugin pass even if a critic module issues some
  warnings. As long as perlcritic says "source OK", we want to treat that as a
  pass, despite any warnings it may issue. Fixed by Mark Fowler.

- Made the caching model pluggable, and added a new
  Code::TidyAll::CacheModel::Shared class as an alternative to the default
  model. This lets you share the cache directory between multiple branches in
  a single checkout while still detecting file changes properly. Implemented
  by Mark Fowler.

[WARNING FOR A FUTURE RELEASE]

- At some point in the future, it will probably be necessary for Code::TidyAll
  to become aware of encodings on a per-file basis. As it stands right now,
  any tidying plugin which reformats text could, in theory, end up splitting
  up a UTF-8 character's bytes across at a line break.

[BUG FIXES]

- Replaced the use of Capture::Tiny with IPC::Run3 for some plugins. The
  former seems to sometimes return character data where we want bytes, even if
  the STDOUT and STDERR handles are binmode()'d to the ":bytes" encoding. This
  prevents warnings about writing wide characters from the JSBeautify plugin.


0.23     2014-11-06

- Fix test failures seen on CPANTesters.

  Perl::Critic, Perl::Tidy, etc.).

[ENHANCEMENTS]

* Test::Code::TidyAll now sets "quiet => 1" when creating the Code::TidyAll
  object to suppress noise from any plugins.

  of before.
