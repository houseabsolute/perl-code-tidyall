- Fixed error when passing in paths as a string to the Code::TidyAll
  constructor. These are now coerced to Path::Tiny objects. Reported by Martin
  Gruner. GH #66.


0.53     2016-10-10

[BUG FIXES]

- Fixed failing tests on OSX. Reported by Martin Gruner. GH #65.

- Files that were tidied could have their permissions mode when they were
  rewritten. Reported by Martin Gruner (GH #68) and fixed by Adam Herzog (GH
  #69).


0.52     2016-09-19

[BUG FIXES]

- The 0.50 release added an implicit configure phase prereq on Path::Tiny
  without declaring it. That bit of code has been reverted to use just core
  modules.

- Change tidyall shbang line to "#!perl". I had changed it to "#!/usr/bin/env
  perl" but MakeMaker does not rewrite this on install.


0.51     2016-09-18

[BUG FIXES]

- Restored some exports to Code::TidyAll::Util for backwards
  compatibility. Some other plugins are using these exports.


0.50     2016-09-18

[BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]

- Converted (almost) all file handling to use Path::Tiny. This should help
  make the code and tests more cross-platform, and simplifies various bits of
  internal code. Note that plugins now receive paths as Path::Tiny objects,
  which could break code that checks if what it receives is a plain scalar.

[ENHANCEMENTS]

- Added support for tidying in multiple parallel jobs at once. You can pass a
  "--jobs" argument to tidyall or pass a "jobs" param to
  Code::TidyAll->new. This requires that you install Parallel::ForkManager.
- Paths in error messages now include the full relative path to the file being
  tidied. Previously this would just be something like "Foo.pm", now it will
  be "lib/My/Package/Foo.pm".


0.49     2016-07-22

- The verbose output now just shows the plugin name in the "applying the
  following plugins: ..." message, rather than stringifying the plugin
  objects.


0.48     2016-06-16

- The Git pre-commit hook now only looks at the files that are staged for
  committing, rather than everything in the git repo that has been
  modified. Note that this does not change the tidyall script's "-g" flag,
  which still operates on all modified files in the repo.

- Check the exit code when running js-beautify and throw an error if this is
  non-zero. Patch by Graham Knop. GitHub #61.


0.46     2016-04-17

- Fix a use line which specified the required version of Text::Diff as
  "v1.44". This caused weirdness to cascade in the Makefile.PL. Reported by
  Olaf Alders. GitHub #60.


0.45     2016-04-11

- Some changes intended to be internal-only in the last release broke the
  handling of ignore and select config lines with multiple space-separated
  values. This should now work again (and is tested). Reported by Martin
  Gruner. GitHub #44.


0.44     2016-04-10

- Changed the shebang config item to actually accept multi items on different
  lines. The old method of specifying more than one item on a single line,
  separated by spaces, will continue to work, but is no longer documented.


0.43     2016-03-27

- Use the same improved "git status" code for Code::TidyAll::Git::Precommit as
  we do in bin/tidyall for the -g option. Patch by Finn Smith. GitHub #57.


0.42     2016-03-10

- Specify Text::Diff version as 'v1.44' instead of '1.44'. This fixes an
  inexplicable error that the OTRS project was having with the previous
  release (GitHub #53). Fixed by Martin Gruner. GitHub #54.


0.41     2016-03-04

- Replaced List::MoreUtils with List::SomeUtils.


0.40     2016-02-21

- Don't include files not tracked by git when looking for uncommitted files.
  Fixed by Olaf Alders. GitHub #51.

- Use Text::Diff for all diffs instead of calling an external
  command. Hopefully this makes this distro a little more portable.


0.39     2016-02-13

- Use "git status --porcelain -z" when trying to figure out what files are
  being uncommitted for git hooks. Implemented by Ricardo Signes. GitHub #40.


0.38     2016-01-11

- Tweaked the test names used by Test::Code::TidyAll so that they say
  something like "lib/Foo.pm is tidy" rather than just "lib/Foo.pm".


0.37     2015-12-03

- Really fix an empty files parameter to tidyall_ok (Test::Code::TidyAll
  desperately needs some tests).


0.36     2015-12-02

- Updated the distro metadata to point to github for bug reports rather than
  rt.cpan.org.


0.35     2015-12-02

- If the "files" parameter to tidyall_ok didn't include any files that matches
  the tidyall config (or no files at all) this would cause an error from
  Test::Builder. This has been fixed so we now just spit out a single passing
  test.


0.34     2015-12-02

- Added a new "files" parameter that can be passed to the tidyall_ok sub
  exported by Test::Code::TidyAll. This makes it possible to use this sub to
  check just a subset of your files.


0.33     2015-11-30 (TRIAL RELEASE)

- Adding diff functionality as its own plugin (DiffOnTidyError), which was
  done in 0.31, turned out to be quite problematic. As a plugin you had to
  define which files it applied to via select & exclude, and in a large code
  base it was easy to select files that no other plugin applied to. This meant
  tidyall (and Test::Code::Tidyall, etc.) would include those files even
  though they were never touched. This could make tidying and tidy tests
  _much_ slower.

  This plugin has been replaced with a new config attribute that can be
  applied to all plugins, diff_on_tidy_error. When this is set, any plugin
  that tidies source in --check-only mode (also used by Test::Code::Tidyall)
  will include a diff in the error message, one diff per plugin. This has the
  added benefit of showing if you if multiple plugins are each making changes
  to the same file.


0.32     2015-11-19

- When in verbose mode we now show what plugins are being applied to each
  file. This is helpful if you want to know why a file isn't being ignored,
  for example.

- Added a new plugin configuration option for the rc file, "weight". You can
  use this to exercise greater control over the order that plugins run in.


0.31     2015-11-17

- Added a new plugin, DiffOnTidyError. This plugin will call "diff -u" to
  compare the original file content to the tidy version.


0.30     2015-09-14

- Added a --no-cleanup option for the tidyall script that causes it to leave
  any tempdirs it creates behind. Implemented by Mark Fowler. GitHub #41.


0.29     2015-08-15

- Replaced use of Digest::SHA1 with Digest::SHA. The latter module has been
  part of the Perl core since 5.10. Implemented by Sergey Romanov. GitHub #39.


0.28     2015-08-06

- The JSON plugin now uses JSON::MaybeXS instead of JSON.pm. Patch by Greg
  Oschwald. GitHub #37.

- Added a new plugin, PerlTidySweet, which uses perltidy-sweet instead of
  perltidy. Implemented by Mark Grimes. GitHub #26.


0.27     2015-07-04

[BUG FIXES]

- Fixed broken POD. Most modules were missing their NAME sections because of a
  mistake in the distro's weaver.ini file. Reported by Красимир Беров.


0.26     2015-06-29

[BUG FIXES]

- The tidyall script did not handle the -I option correctly. It was treated as
  a boolean rather than a string, meaning it basically ignored whatever you
  passed. Fixed by Andy Jack. GH #35.

- The PodChecker plugin no longer generates warnings about an undef variable
  if the file did not have any Pod.

- Added an option for the tidyall config file, shebang. This is an additional
  filter that selects files based on the shebang line
  (#!/bin/foo). Implemented by timgimyee. GH #25.


0.25     2015-03-31

[ENHANCEMENTS]

- You can now pass "verbose => 1" to tidyall_ok(). Previously this would have
  been overridden because we unconditionally set "quiet => 1", but now we only
  do this when verbose is not specified.

- Added a new "msg_outputter" attribute to Code::TidyAll. By default, this is
  a sub that simply calls "printf", but you can pass something else to change
  how messages are printed. Test::Code::TidyAll uses this to send messages
  through diag().

- If you set "verbose => 1" when calling Test::Code::TidyAll, it will now use
  Text::Diff::Table to show details of how a file needs to be tidied in order
  to pass the tidyall checks.

- Made the PerlCritic plugin pass even if a critic module issues some
  warnings. As long as perlcritic says "source OK", we want to treat that as a
  pass, despite any warnings it may issue. Fixed by Mark Fowler.

- Made the caching model pluggable, and added a new
  Code::TidyAll::CacheModel::Shared class as an alternative to the default
  model. This lets you share the cache directory between multiple branches in
  a single checkout while still detecting file changes properly. Implemented
  by Mark Fowler.


0.24     2014-11-06

[WARNING FOR A FUTURE RELEASE]

- At some point in the future, it will probably be necessary for Code::TidyAll
  to become aware of encodings on a per-file basis. As it stands right now,
  any tidying plugin which reformats text could, in theory, end up splitting
  up a UTF-8 character's bytes across at a line break.

[BUG FIXES]

- Replaced the use of Capture::Tiny with IPC::Run3 for some plugins. The
  former seems to sometimes return character data where we want bytes, even if
  the STDOUT and STDERR handles are binmode()'d to the ":bytes" encoding. This
  prevents warnings about writing wide characters from the JSBeautify plugin.


0.23     2014-11-06

- Fix test failures seen on CPANTesters.
